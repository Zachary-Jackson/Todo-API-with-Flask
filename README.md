# Todo-API-with-Flask
Take a working Angular JS Todo application and get it running via REST APIs developed in the Flask. The Angular JS app uses the ng-resource plugin to automatically work with REST. This is a challenge issued by www.teamtreehouse.com for a Python Web Development Tech Degree Project. All of the Angular JS is considered built by teamtreehouse for this project(unless otherwise noted), but may be edited by me at some point.
